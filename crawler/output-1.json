The short answer is yes, because it contains caffeine!\n\nOn average, matcha contains approximately 20-45mg of caffeine per gram. So with a normal serving of matcha green tea powder being 2-4 grams (1-2 teaspoons depending on how you like it), that's around 40-180mg of caffeine per cup of matcha.\n\nKeep in mind the variation of caffeine in matcha powder stems from the huge differences in the quality of matcha powders. As a general rule of thumb, the higher-quality matcha you choose, the higher the caffeine content will be.\n\nFor comparison, 1 cup of brewed coffee has between 80-100mg of caffeine, while a double shot of espresso typically has around 60-150mg of caffeine.\n\nMatcha tea powder also provides longer-lasting alertness (6-8hrs) without the jitters compared to coffee (3-4hrs) — so you don't need to drink as much or worry about anxiety-inducing effects to reap the energy-boosting benefits. \n\nKeep reading to learn everything you need to know about caffeine in matcha.\n\nWhat is matcha?\n\nMatcha is a high-quality type of green tea that uses whole tea-leaves heavily shaded during growth and then grounded into powdered form. It can be enjoyed with steaming hot water, as a latte, on ice, and can be used as a color-popping ingredient in cooking that adds an extra health boost to sweet & savory recipes.\n\nHave you considered matcha as your caffeine drink of choice? Caffeine from matcha green tea powder promotes energy without the jitters or crash that comes with coffee.\n\nMost people are accustomed to having a cup of coffee to start the morning. Sixty-two percent of US adults say they consume coffee every day. (1) However, over the past few decades, nutritional science has debated if coffee is healthy — and if there's a better way to get a boost of energy without the downsides.\n\nLearn about 11 health benefits of switching to matcha from coffee here.\n\nThis is where matcha and caffeine in matcha comes in.\n\nWith countless body-cleansing and supportive components, matcha green tea powder is one of nature's oldest solutions to a healthier, more energized self, and it's been more scientifically tested than any other 'superfoods' you can likely name. (2)\n\nDoes matcha have caffeine?\n\nMatcha has caffeine aka matcha is caffeinated. According to research, the typical amount of caffeine in matcha is 18 to 50 mg/g, depending on the quality of the matcha. For example, exactly how the matcha is grown, harvested, and prepared can hugely impact its caffeine levels. (5)\n\nWondering how much caffeine is found in our brand of matcha powder? Our superior grade daily matcha and ceremonial matcha have all been vigorously lab tested, and carry 37.5mg to over 50 mg of caffeine per gram of matcha powdered green tea, which is considered the typical serving portion. (5) (6)\n\n \n\n\nMatcha is best stored in an airtight tin container in the freezer, as oxygen can quickly cause it to degrade.\n\nDo matcha lattes have caffeine?\n\nLike lattes made with coffee, matcha lattes do contain caffeine, but the amount of caffeine can vary greatly depending on the quality and age of the matcha powder. Often a matcha latte is a drink served hot or on ice, made with matcha tea, water and milk. One serving typically contains 2-3 grams of matcha. This means one matcha latte typically provides somewhere between 50-150 mg of caffeine depending on the quality of the matcha green tea powder.\n\nMatcha caffeine vs. green tea caffeine\n\nCaffeine content in matcha is relatively higher than other bagged green tea varieties, which is one of the reasons matcha has such a lovely, unique aroma and flavor. When comparing caffeine levels, green teas fall within a range of 11.3–24.67 mg/g, packing about half the amount of caffeine found in matcha powdered green tea. Keep in mind that the caffeine content of whatever type of matcha beverage you are having varies depending on how much powder is added. (5)\n\nMatcha is derived from the same plant as green tea, but it is grown and prepared differently. Matcha tea powder is packed with nutrients from the entire green tea leaf, resulting in a higher quality and amount of caffeine and other powerful antioxidants than bagged green tea. (5)\n\nSo one cup (8 ounces) of standard matcha that uses 4 teaspoons of powder can have well over 200 mg of caffeine, while a cup of regular green tea that size provides up to 25 mg of caffeine. However, most people don't drink a full cup of matcha at once because of its much higher caffeine content. With matcha green tea powder, less really is more. (5)\n\nMatcha caffeine vs. coffee caffeine\n\nWhen it comes to comparing caffeine levels, coffee contains more caffeine per serving than matcha. For example, the average cup of coffee contains 96 mg of caffeine per 8 ounces, while a 2-ounce cup of matcha tea, when prepared traditionally with one teaspoon, contains about 18–50 mg/g. And did you know just one 1-ounce shot of espresso has up to 100 mg of caffeine? (5) (8)\n\nMost coffee drinkers cannot rely on just one cup of coffee to get them through even half their day. The boost from coffee's caffeine usually lasts a mere 1–3 hours and then leads to a sudden crash in energy levels. Then it's time for another cup. (4) (2)\n\nHaving the four 8-ounce cups of coffee you may think you need to get you through the day, which is around 400 mg of caffeine, can be harmful to your health. Consuming up to 400mg/day of caffeine from coffee, or about 4 cups, has been shown to double the risk of headaches, panic attacks, feelings of being trapped or caught, anxiety, and feelings of worthlessness. (7)\n\nHowever, matcha releases slowly in the body, so you aren't left with an uneasy feeling. Caffeine from matcha tea powder promotes a state of relaxation and overall well-being, providing 6 hours of sustained energy. (5)\n\nBodies process caffeine in matcha in a healthier, slower way\n\nOur bodies process caffeine from matcha and coffee differently. Because matcha has higher phytonutrient levels, matcha caffeine release happens in a much slower, much healthier way than coffee caffeine. (5) \n\nDigestion of caffeine from matcha\n\nWhen you drink matcha, your body absorbs the caffeine in a way that combats a lot of side effects that you get from drinking coffee. \n\nThe caffeine molecules in matcha green tea powder bind to the larger catechin molecules. Catechins are powerful antioxidants that are naturally broken down and slowly assimilated. This leads to the gradual breakdown of caffeine into the bloodstream. This slow process is what allows matcha to provide sustained, level energy for up to 6-8 hours. (5) (9)\n\nHow the body processes caffeine from coffee leads to spikes in adrenaline, glucose, and insulin levels, which is why people often experience a crash when their blood sugar drops. \n\nL-Theanine in matcha\n\nMatcha also helps balance blood sugar and process caffeine calmly thanks to L-theanine—a rare amino acid that is also a key player in promoting relaxation and soothing your nerves. It also modifies the effect of caffeine, giving you a feeling of relaxed alertness.\n\n\nL-theanine allows you to drink matcha later in the day and not worry about having trouble falling asleep. Thus, matcha can positively impact quality of sleep and also be a great alternative to coffee if you suffer from caffeine sensitivity. (5) \n\nHow much caffeine is in our on-the-go matcha packs for travel?\n\nThe serving of our on-the-go travel matcha tea powder is 1.5 grams. According to studies, one gram of matcha powder often has between 19-44 mg of caffeine. Often the higher the quality, the higher the caffeine content and time spent being shade-grown. So for our 1.5 gram travel-sized matcha green tea powder packets, there is around 50-75mg of caffeine in our packets. This is a bit less than your average cup of filtered coffee, & definitely no more than 90mg of caffeine. It's important to know if you may be keeping track of your caffeine intake while pregnant or breastfeeding. (5)\n\nHow much caffeine is in a typical serving of matcha? \n\nFor high-quality matcha tea powder, 1.5 grams is more than enough, though if you prefer your matcha stronger, some people use a typical serving size of 2-4 grams of matcha powder (1/2-1 teaspoon), which may contain 38 to 176 mg of caffeine. (5)\n\nCompared to other green tea varieties, matcha typically has more caffeine content. You can read more about the differences between loose-leaf green tea and matcha powder here.\n\nHow long does matcha last in your system?\n\nWith matcha green tea powder, it typically takes 30 minutes to feel the energizing effects after you consume it. It can last as long as six to eight hours. Furthermore, the “crash” many people experience the hour or two after they drink coffee doesn't happen with matcha tea.\n\nFinal thoughts on matcha caffeine vs. coffee caffeine \n\nWhile a cup of espresso in the morning will wake you up, it also spikes your stress hormones. Coffee caffeine is absorbed rapidly into the bloodstream, but you may notice after an hour that you have less energy and are more grumpy than you were before. Unlike coffee, caffeine from matcha green tea powder is absorbed very slowly into the body, giving you a long and sustained energy boost rather than a quick spike.\n\n\n\nOur superior quality matcha delivers numerous superpowered health benefits that include up to six hours of sustained energy, mental clarity, and calm alertness. You can easily add a cup of matcha to your daily routine or opt to mix culinary-grade matcha into your favorite recipes in the kitchen. \n\nAre you looking to transition from coffee to matcha green tea powder? We've got you covered.\n\nLearn step-by-step how to switch from drinking coffee to drinking matcha and not experience any unpleasant withdrawal symptoms of coffee.\n\nDisclaimer: These statements in this blog post have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

It can also be a great source of caffeine energy, which is why we enjoy matcha so much at Zest Tea! In this guide, we're outlining what matcha tea is, how to make it, what to expect from the flavor, and most importantly, how much caffeine it contains.\nIf you'd like to try a highly caffeinated tea without all the whisking and frothing, check out our Energy Drinks next.\nWHAT IS MATCHA GREEN TEA?\n\nMatcha is a Japanese green tea type made from the Camellia sinensis plant. This plant produces numerous varieties - some are great for black tea, others for green tea, and some that are grown in Japan are best for matcha.\n\nThere are two key things that separate matcha tea from a regular green tea:\n\nThe green tea plants are shade-grown, which changes the flavor, L-Theanine and caffeine levels,\nOnce harvested and dried, the veins and stalks are removed, then the tea leaf is ground into a fine powder.\n\nSo instead of soaking tea leaves in water to produce a green tea, with matcha you need to whisk the powdered tea directly into water. You can think of it almost like making an instant coffee.\n\nTraditionally, only the highest grade of matcha is consumed as tea, during a Japanese tea ceremony. This grade of matcha is known as ceremonial grade, while lower grades are used for culinary purposes, e.g. baking recipes, or flavoring and coloring foods.\n\nOne interesting fact is that although matcha is most well-known as a Japanese tea type, it's origins are actually in China!\n\nMATCHA FLAVOR\n\nMatcha has a rich, green and grassy taste. Compared to regular green tea, the flavor is more vibrant. This tea type can also have an astringent quality and slight bitterness, although the texture is usually silky smooth with micro-foam on top (when whisked well).\n\nDifferent brands will sometimes flavor their matcha to create a new taste. Vanilla, blueberry, lemon... there are endless flavor combinations that can be added to matcha to give it a tasty flavor. And there's also the matcha latte, which involves using a strong shot of matcha instead of espresso with hot foamy milk.\n\nINGREDIENTS AND NUTRITION\n\nMatcha is a low calorie drink, just like other tea types. An average matcha green tea contains just 3 calories, 0 carbs, and 1 gram of fiber. Matcha powder is also a source of iron, vitamin C and vitamin A, although in very small quantities per serving.\n\nWhen you are drinking matcha, you also consume water to rehydrate your body and numerous other nutritional components, including polyphenols and the antioxidant amino acid L-Theanine. Matcha is higher in both caffeine and this important amino acid than standard green tea leaves. Together, they have a synergistic effect, meaning that they work together.\n\nThe caffeine content in matcha provides energy, while the L-Theanine provides calm, focus and productivity. This amino acid found naturally in the tea plant can also slow down the energy boost, for smoother and prolonged productivity. If you're interested in the science, read 'High Caffeine Tea - Everything You Need to Know'.\n\nHEALTH BENEFITS\n\nMatcha is rich in antioxidants which have numerous benefits for your body.\n\nA study into the stress-reducing effects of matcha found that it significantly lowered anxiety levels too.\nDrinking matcha enhanced fat oxidation in females when it was consumed before a brisk 30-minute walk.\nThere's evidence that matcha protects against cognitive decline in the elderly.\n\nThe health benefits of matcha are closely linked to the health benefits of all green teas, so if you want to learn more about health benefits, side effects, EGCG and antioxidants, read our article 'Green Tea: What's In It and Why It Matters'.\n\nMATCHA GREEN TEA CAFFEINE CONTENT\n\nDrinking an 8-ounce serving of matcha made with 1 scoop (2 grams/half a teaspoon) of matcha powder will provide roughly 70mg of caffeine.\n\nMatcha vs Regular Green Tea\n\nRegular green teas contain 25mg per brewed cup (8oz) on average. This is less than matcha as the tea leaves are removed, rather than ground into the drink, and they aren't typically shade grown.\n\nMatcha vs Coffee and Energy Drinks\n\nA standard cup of coffee contains 96mg of caffeine and a shot of espresso (1oz) contains 64mg. Energy drinks vary, but they're usually more than coffee or around the same.\n\nThe biggest difference is the nutrients - coffee and energy drinks lack L-Theanine for a smooth, prepared energy boost. Energy drinks often contain a lot of sugar too. This leads to a bigger energy crash than you'd get with matcha.\n\nFor wellness, matcha wins hands-down even if the caffeine boost is slightly lower.\n\nZest High Caffeine Green Tea\n\nZest Teas are higher than matcha and coffee when it comes to caffeine. Although we don't currently have a matcha green tea to offer, drinking our high caffeine green teas provides up to 135mg of caffeine per beverage.\n\nFor smooth grassy green tea notes with tropical hints (and a great plant-powered energy boost), check out our Pomegranate Mojito.\n\nHOW TO MAKE MATCHA TEA\n\nIt's a simple process, albeit not as simple as a standard green tea.\n\nAdd half a teaspoon or 1 scoop of matcha powder to your cup,\nStart with a small splash of water and use your whisk to combine the powder with it, until there are no lumps,\nPour in your hot water and whisk vigorously to incorporate the water and powder with air until a good foam forms.\n\n3 TIPS TO MAKE THE BEST CUP OF MATCHA\n\nIf you want to take your cup of matcha to the next level, these three tips will help you get there.\n\nWater Temperature\n\nUse hot water to whisk your matcha, but not boiling water! The key is to use water that's roughly 80°C/176°C. This prevents you scalding the matcha and enhancing the bitter flavors.\n\nUse a thermometer if you want to be precise, or just wait a few minutes for your water to cool after it reaches boiling point.\n\nSieving\n\nSieving the powder gets rid of the clumps that can form even in high quality matcha. You might see more clumps forming over time, where the matcha's exposed to moisture. So, sieve your matcha into your cup so it's smoother and easier to whisk.\n\nWhisking\n\nWe recommend using a bamboo whisk instead of an electric metal whisk for your matcha. Bamboo won't impart any flavor in your cup of matcha, it won't damage your matcha bowl, and it gives you more control over the foam you create. The key is to use a zigzag motion instead of a circular motion. And yes, your arm will ache afterwards... but it's worth it!\n\nFAQS\nIS MATCHA STRONGER THAN C\noff\nEE\n?\n\nIn terms of flavor, both matcha and coffee have a strong taste and bitterness, but they're very different. In terms of caffeine, matcha green tea has less than a standard cup of coffee but more than a single shot of espresso.\n\nIS THERE CAFFEINE IN MATCHA TEA?\n\nYes! Matcha contains more caffeine than most green teas. It has roughly 70mg of caffeine per serving. Of course, some of our Energy Teas at Zest can provide up to 200mg - it's quite the energy boost!\n\nIS MATCHA CAFFEINE BAD?\n\nNo, the caffeine levels in a cup of matcha are way less than the FDA daily recommended limit of 400mg. Furthermore, matcha contains L-Theanine which is a natural amino acid that smooths and prolongs the effects of caffeine. So, you won't get the jitters and crash you'd normally expect with a high caffeine energy drink or coffee.\n\nIS MATCHA POWDER HIGH IN CAFFEINE?\n\nYes, matcha powder is high in caffeine. There's roughly 70mg of caffeine in one serving of matcha green tea, compared to a standard green tea which contains 28mg and black tea which contains 47mg. Compared to a cup of coffee or Zest High Caffeine Tea, however, matcha has fewer caffeine mg per serving.\n\n \n\n \n\nSOURCES\n \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matcha\nhttps://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/1714783/nutrients\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30308973/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29345213/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33256220/\nhttps://www.healthline.com/nutrition/caffeine-in-tea-vs-coffee#caffeine-concerns\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20049372\nhttps://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much\nShare\nBack to blog\nABOUT\nABOUT US\nFIND US\nJOIN OUR TEAM\nPRESS\nBLOG\nTERMS\nSHIPPING & RETURNS\nTERMS OF SERVICE\nPRIVACY POLICY\nHELP\nCONTACT US\nFAQ\nWHOLESALE SETUP\nREWARDS\nLETS STAY IN TOUCH\nSIGN UP\nTWITTER\nFACEBOOK\nINSTAGRAM\n© 2024 ZEST.

Drinking matcha is an excellent choice if you’re sensitive to caffeine but still need a morning pick-me-up. Matcha has the highest level of caffeine compared to other green teas - but it’s not that simple.\n\n\n\n\nSeveral factors, from quality to harvesting methods, play a part in matcha caffeine content. Whether you're an avid drinker or trying matcha out for the first time, understanding how much caffeine is in matcha is essential to how you can enjoy it.\n\n\n\nWhat Determines Caffeine Content\n\nAll styles of green teas contain caffeine, but levels differ widely based on how the leaves are processed. Tea plants produce caffeine as a chemical defense mechanism to protect themselves from insects. Humans have had quite the opposite response and consume tea for its taste, caffeine content, and health benefits. \n\nDetermining how much caffeine is in matcha and other green teas boils down to multiple factors such as:\n\n\n\nTea Quality: Tea quality plays a huge part in caffeine in matcha and other teas. High-quality tea generally comes from younger tea leaves. The younger the leaves are at harvest, the higher the caffeine level can be.\nStyle of Tea: Different tea styles contain different levels of caffeine. For example, the caffeine in matcha and gyokuro can be higher than in other styles of green teas.\nShading: Some Japanese teas are shaded prior to harvest to increase sweetness and umami for a particular style. Usually, as the leaves become bigger, they contain less caffeine. The shading process reduces the speed of loss of caffeine.\nPicking: Matcha caffeine content also depends on the parts of the plant used and the age of the leaves when picked. Teas like matcha, made from spring harvests versus later subsequent harvests, have significantly more caffeine.\nProcessing Method: When certain teas are processed, the stems are removed. Teas with fewer stems contain more caffeine.\nServing Size: How much matcha powder or loose tea leaves you use in your serving will affect caffeine levels.\nBrewing Temperature and Time: Brewing tea at higher temperatures can result in a higher caffeine level. Also, the longer you brew loose leaf teas, the more caffeine is extracted from the leaves.\nWay of Consumption: Consuming hot tea or cold tea, as well as tea with water or milk, affects caffeine levels.\n\nWith all these factors involved, it’s clear how the caffeine in matcha and other green teas can widely vary. Not to mention, all teas aren’t created equally. Therefore, our discussion of how much caffeine is in matcha and other green teas will focus on high-quality teas like those offered by Mizuba Tea Co.\n\n\n\n\nCaffeine in Matcha\n\nSo, does Match have Caffeine? The answer is, YES! Studies have found that matcha can contain between 19 and 44 milligrams of caffeine. Most high-quality matcha contains about 34 milligrams of caffeine per gram of matcha powder. In traditional consumption, a typical serving of matcha is about 2 grams of powder to 100 milliliters (about 3.5 ounces) of water. That would be about 68 milligrams of caffeine in a recommended serving. Matcha is regarded as a high-caffeine green tea because you can increase the level of caffeine in your serving simply by adding more powder.\n\n\n\n\nMatcha could potentially contain more caffeine than coffee, depending on how it's prepared. For example, if you were to make an 8-ounce cup of matcha, it could contain more caffeine than a drip coffee of the same size. Don’t be alarmed, though! Caffeine in matcha is released and absorbed in a completely different way from coffee. More on that – read on!\n\n\n\nCaffeine in Matcha vs. Other Green Teas\n\nThe difference between the level of caffeine in matcha and other green teas is how the tea is consumed. With matcha, all the caffeine is consumed at once since the whole tea leaf is ground into a powder. \n\n\n\n\nGreen teas extracted from loose tea leaves must be steeped several times to extract all of the caffeine. With loose leaf teas, you also steep the leaves and then remove them, only consuming the infused water. A typical serving of loose leaf green tea is 5 grams of tea leaves to 150-180 milliliters (about 5 to 6 ounces) of water.\n\n\n\n\nThe caffeine in matcha may be the highest of all green teas, but other green teas like gyokuro aren’t too far behind. Similar to matcha, gyokuro is shaded for about 21 days before harvesting. The caffeine level in gyokuro is a bit lower than in matcha because the leaves are steeped, then removed after being infused into water. However, a recommended serving of gyokuro contains about 120 to 140 milligrams of caffeine which is higher than a recommended serving of matcha.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, sencha, one of the most consumed green teas with the most categories, contains about 50 to 60 milligrams of caffeine in each serving. Most senchas are unshaded, hence their lower caffeine content. \n\n\n\n\nHowever, kabuse sencha (kabusecha) is an exception. Kabusecha is shaded for less time than gyokuro and matcha and contains about 60 to 70 milligrams of caffeine per serving. Of course – everyone’s caffeine sensitivities are different, so you may find you are more affected by certain styles of teas than others!\n\n\n\nWhat Makes Caffeine in Matcha Different\n\nAs mentioned earlier, caffeine in matcha is unique in how it is released and absorbed after consumption. Matcha is very high in antioxidants and amino acids. Caffeine in matcha is released at the same time as the amino acid, L-theanine, which suppresses and antagonizes the stimulant effect of caffeine.\n\n\n\n\nSome describe the synergy between caffeine and L-theanine as a calm, alert feeling that lasts throughout the day without the dreaded crash. L-theanine also reduces anxiety, stress, and insomnia while creating a sustained energy boost.\n\n\n\nQuality is Key\n\nNo matter what caffeine level you’re looking for, quality is an overarching factor in the level of caffeine in matcha and other green teas. Choosing high-quality teas elevates your experience while indulging in all the benefits of tea drinking. \n\n\n\n\nAt Mizuba Tea Co., our teas are sourced with the highest level of tradition and care.

You need matcha in your life. Here's our 7 reasons to switch from coffee to matcha.\n\nWhat is matcha?\n\nOriginating in Japan hundreds of years ago, matcha green tea is taking the world by storm. Made from the same leaves as green and black tea, matcha involves grinding whole green tea leaves into a fine powder. This means matcha powder preserves more nutrients and flavour, so it’s super healthy as well as delicious.\n\nWhat does Matcha taste like?\n\nBrew up the green powder and you’ll find yourself with a bright drink with strong yet well-balanced, earthy flavours. Most matcha has a deep, grassy taste with a hint of nuttiness. It’s often described as umami, making you want to come back for another sip every time.\n\nRead our complete Matcha Tea Taste Guide to find out more...\n\nDoes Matcha contain caffeine?\n\nMatcha does contain caffeine, although it’s less than most cups of coffee. On average, a cup of matcha contains about 70mg of caffeine, in comparison to 100-140mg in a cup of coffee. But as you’ll find out soon, matcha can keep you feeling alert for much longer than coffee can.\n\nHow much matcha should you consume?\n\nYou can consume up to 2-3 servings of matcha per day. The recommended serving size for Matcha is 1-2g per serving.\n\nMatcha Tea Benefits over Coffee\n\nWhile coffee and matcha both have their own health benefits, matcha is better for you overall and has fewer potential side effects. It’s gentler on the body and is good for you in so many different ways.\n\nIf you want all of the caffeine with none of the drawbacks of coffee, matcha is the way to go. Need more convincing? Here are seven reasons why matcha is healthier than coffee:\n\n1. Matcha is full of antioxidants\n\nLike its cousin, green tea, matcha is full of powerful antioxidants (polyphenols). And because of the way it's made - grinding up the full leaves - even more of the good stuff is retained by matcha powder. In fact, matcha is one of the most antioxidant-rich foods around.\n\nAntioxidants have multiple different benefits. They can help fight disease and infection, slow ageing, reduce inflammation, prevent some forms of cancer, and much more. There are about 10 times as many antioxidants in a cup of matcha as in green tea and coffee doesn’t contain any.\n\n2. Matcha regulates your energy\n\nEver had the jitters after drinking a cup of coffee? Or felt yourself crash a few hours later? That’s because of the way coffee releases its caffeine. It happens quickly in a flash. This means coffee can make your adrenaline spike, plus it can affect your glucose and insulin levels, so you could be left shakey and hungry.\n\nMatcha, however, has a much “cleaner” caffeine high. The caffeine is released slowly, giving you a longer, smoother hit of energy. This is down to the amino acid L-Theanine, which reduces how quickly the body absorbs caffeine.\n\nWhile matcha contains less caffeine than a cup of coffee, it could keep you feeling alert for much longer — some say from three-six hours. And all this without the risk of the jitters. Because of this, matcha could be a good alternative for anyone who wants to enjoy an energy boost but is particularly sensitive to caffeine\n\n3. Matcha can calm your nerves\n\nThe same amino acid that slows caffeine absorption can also make you feel calmer. The L-Theanine found in matcha has been proven to help people sleep. When combined with matcha’s gentle caffeine release, it also leads to a feeling of calm.\n\nSome people can find that coffee, on the other hand, worsens feelings of anxiety. Drinking more than one cup a day can make you more likely to feel worried. Plus, you may experience physical signs of anxiety, like heart palpitations or shaking.\n\nThere’s a reason Buddhist monks use matcha to meditate: it makes your brain feel clear, calm and yet alert.\n\n4. Matcha isn’t addictive\n\nIf you’ve ever tried to quit a coffee habit you might have noticed some side effects. Headaches, fatigue, nausea and muscle pain are some of the symptoms commonly associated with coffee withdrawal.\n\nWithdrawal symptoms are caused by the coffee energy spike. Because it happens quickly, your body craves more caffeine to replicate the boost it just had. When you go without, you really notice the difference.\n\nLuckily, you won’t have the same problem with matcha. Your body won’t become dependent on it in quite the same way so if you go a few days without a cup, you’ll still feel right as rain.\n\n5. Matcha is better for your teeth\n\nUnlike coffee, matcha won’t stain your teeth. Even better, it can actually improve your oral health.\n\nThe superpowered antioxidants found in matcha fight the bacteria that grow in your mouth and cause damage. At the same time, matcha can reduce plaque build-up and relieve the symptoms of gum disease.\n\nSwitching to matcha will mean no coffee breath and better oral hygiene overall.\n\n6. Matcha is helpful for weight loss\n\nMatcha has been shown to improve metabolism and burn fat by tackling weight loss from both sides which will increase higher energy levels and putting you into fat burning mode safely, without raising your blood pressure or cortisol levels.Studies have found that matcha is particularly good at increasing fat loss when consumed before workouts. \n\n \n\n7. Matcha is easy to prepare\n\nAnother bonus? A cup of matcha is easier to get right than brewing a great cup of coffee. And you’ll need less equipment.\n\nOnce you’ve perfected your matcha making technique, you’ll make the perfect cup every time in less than 30 seconds.\n\n \n\nHow do I make Matcha?\n\nThe process is simple: whisk matcha powder into hot water to get your brew ready. If you’d prefer a matcha latte, you can mix the powder with steamed milk. No massive espresso machine, scales or grinder needed.\n\n How do I get started with matcha?\n\nFor beginners, we’d recommend choosing our complete matcha set which includes everything you need to start brewing: whisk, bowl and the matcha itself.\n\nOnce you have the tools nailed down, explore the varying tastes of our matcha blends until you find your favourites.\n\nTry out our Ceremonial Grade with our choice your own sample with purchase.\n\n \n\nAnd remember, the better quality the matcha, the better the taste. \n\nSHARE\n\nRead last blog\nRead next blog\n\nComments (3)\n\nThe Tea Makers Team on Jul 17, 2023\n\nHi Emran,\nAs our Ceremonial Grade Matcha is in powder form this comes in loose or in individual sachets.\nWe do however also have Sencha Iri Matcha and Genmaicha Iri Matcha teas which you can use in our reuseable fill your own teabags :)\n\nAntonia on Jul 17, 2023\n\nI trying it today for the first time.

To make a cup of matcha, you simply whisk the powder with hot water and enjoy the bright green brew. Matcha was originally used in tea ceremonies in Japan and has grown in popularity around the world. It is high in antioxidants and other healthy compounds, making it a winner for both flavor and benefits. The taste is much stronger than regular green tea, and the caffeine content is higher. This makes it a great choice for an energizing drink in the morning. \n\nCaffeine boost: Coffee or Matcha?\n\nThe most popular morning beverages contain caffeine, and any long-time coffee drinker can attest to the eventual jitters that become a part of our daily lives after the first 5 or 7… or 10 cups of joe. Unlike coffee or energy drinks though, matcha skips the jitters and provides a long-lasting, even-tempered boost in energy. It helps promote increased brain function while reducing anxiety and stress – without the typical drowsiness that comes along with anything else that may have calming effects. That makes matcha the perfect partner for someone with a desk job, or more obviously, a student! (Or… really anyone)\n\nHow much caffeine is in matcha?\n\nGreen tea naturally contains caffeine, but there is a surprising amount of nuance between different types. How the tea is grown, processed, and steeped affects the caffeine content. A typical cup of green tea falls in the range of 25-45 mg of caffeine per 8oz cup. That’s less than black tea, which is usually 45-75 mg per 8oz cup. And far less caffeine than coffee, which has between 80-110 mg per 8oz cup. But don’t generalize too quickly, matcha green tea has 60-70 mg of caffeine per 8oz cup! To summarize, matcha has the perfect amount to wake you up without overdoing it.\n\nMore caffeine than other green teas\n\nMatcha has the most caffeine of any green tea. The difference is that matcha tea leaves are made into a powder. While most green teas are infused in water and then strained out, matcha powder is mixed into water and consumed entirely. This makes for a thick, green drink and a much higher amount of caffeine. If you need to jump start your morning, matcha is the right choice!\n\n\"I have really enjoyed this Matcha, i drink it every morning and it gives me enough energy throughout the day!\" -Elaine\n\nIs caffeine bad for you?\n\nJust because there's more caffeine in a cup of matcha than in a cup of your normal green tea does not make this an unhealthy option. The caffeine that is in tea has a much more sustained release than the caffeine that's found in coffee. It does this with this other handy little amino acid called L-Theanine that is plentiful in green teas. Due to the presence of theanine, and since the body processes all pure teas like water, you get the pure hydration effects along with the slower release of caffeine through the body. This avoids the common jolt and crash that you might experience with the caffeine associated with coffee while offering a calm alertness that will stay with you, keeping you at an even energy level for a longer period of time.\n\nHow much caffeine is too much?\n\nAccording to the FDA, \"For healthy adults, the FDA has cited 400 milligrams a day—that's about four or five cups of coffee—as an amount not generally associated with dangerous, negative effects\". Keep in mind this is a general number and varies based on many factors such as medical conditions, medications, caffeine sensitivities or metabolism rates.\n\n\n\n\nAs an adult, we don't advise more than three cups of matcha a day - however five cups are the maximum you should ever consume. Although matcha has less caffeine than coffee, it can keep you feeling alert for longer. This is due to how the caffeine is metabolized.\n\n\n\n\nThe caffeine in a cup of matcha combines with the L-theanine in a way that slows the body's absorption of caffeine. This slow release prevents the typical caffeine crash that coffee, soft drinks and energy drinks are known to cause.\n\nChoosing your Matcha:\n\nMany matcha varieties are sold in tins and bags, committing you to a larger quantity. Single serving sachets offers added convenience by allowing your matcha to remain fresh in individually sealed pouches. Now with more flavors of matcha available, the question is - what flavor will you choose?\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not sure, we recommend purchasing a matcha variety pack. Here you can try 8 different samples of matcha to find out your favorites. Each matcha sachet holds 3 grams of matcha, allowing you to make a full 16 ounces of tea.\n\nslide 4 to 5 of 5\n\nDoes Green Tea Have Caffeine?

Here’s What To Know\n\nIt does have much more caffeine than regular green tea...\n\nBY KORIN MILLER AND JACKIE LAMUPDATED: FEB 24, 2023\nSAVE ARTICLE\nBERNICE KOH / EYEEM//GETTY IMAGES\n\nWomen's Health may earn commission from the links on this page, but we only feature products we believe in. Why Trust Us?\n\nMatcha is having a moment as the new super drink on the block. Made by grinding up young tea leaves from the Camellia sinensis plant (the same one that black and oolong come from), matcha boasts a number of benefits, from promoting healthier cholesterol levels to improving brain function. If you're looking to swap out your morning coffee but still want an energy boost, you may be wondering, Does matcha have caffeine?\n\nFirst, you should know you're doing your body a solid by switching to matcha. “It provides the same health benefits of green tea, amplified,” says nutritionist Jessica Cording, RD, the author of The Little Book of Game-Changers.\n\nSince you consume the actual tea leaves when drinking matcha, you get about twice the amount of the antioxidant EGCG that you would from drinking regular green tea, adds New York-based nutritionist Asako Miyashita, RDN.\n\nIn case you're not familiar, though originally from China, matcha has strong ties to Japan. In the 12th century, Japanese Buddhist monk Myoan Eisai left for China to find green tea, according to Miyashita. “Eisai realized that drinking matcha before meditation helped maintain his concentration,\" she says. So he brought the matcha back to Japan and wrote a book called Kissa Yojoki (Drinking Tea).\n\nTraditionally, only matcha made from Japanese tea leaves was considered legitimate, but these days, it's produced pretty much everywhere.\n\nMeet the experts: Asako Miyashita is a nutritionist based in New York City. Keri Gans is a nutritionist and the author of The Small Change Diet. Jessica Cording is a nutritionist and the author of The Little Book of Game-Changers.\n\n“The tea leaves are cultivated under cover to avoid direct sunlight for three to four weeks from April to May,” Miyashita explains. “This process increases the leaves' chlorophyll content and amino acid content, and creates a darker green color.” It also suppresses the formation of catechin, the compound that gives green tea a bitter taste.\n\nInterested in adding matcha to your routine? Here's what to know about how matcha's caffeine content compares to coffee.\n\nIs matcha high in caffeine?\n\nThe short answer is it depends. Just like green tea, which contains about 28 milligrams of caffeine per eight-ounce cup, matcha contains caffeine. Since you drink the actual tea leaves with matcha, though, it contains more caffeine than your standard cup o' green.\n\nLike other teas—and coffee!—the amount of caffeine in a cup of matcha can vary, says nutritionist Keri Gans, RD, author of The Small Change Diet. Typically, an eight-ounce cup of matcha, which is made with one teaspoon of matcha powder, contains 70 milligrams of caffeine. “However, depending on how concentrated one likes their cup, it could have a little less or more,” she says.\n\nBut wait...Is matcha stronger than coffee?\n\nIn general, a cup of matcha will contain less caffeine than a cup of coffee. That said, the exact difference can seriously vary from cup to cup. An eight-ounce cup of regular coffee can contain anywhere from 95 to 200 milligrams of caffeine, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.\n\nDepending on how strong your usual brew is, your average cup of matcha can contain anywhere from 25 to 130 fewer grams of caffeine.\n\nWatch coffee-lover Jillian Michaels break down what's in her fridge:\n\nIf you're a fan of espresso, the caffeine levels are more comparable. One shot of espresso averages around 63 milligrams of caffeine, according to the USDA.\n\nAnd if you usually go for decaf? A cup typically ranges between two and 15 milligrams of caffeine. So, in this case, a cup of matcha would actually give you more of a buzz.\n\n\nWill you have a caffeine crash after drinking matcha?\n\nIf one of your qualms with coffee is that you get a quick hit of energy only to come crashing down, well, consider yourself about to be even more intrigued by matcha.\n\nRELATED STORY\nCaffeine Lovers Swear By Coffee Subscription Boxes\n\nMatcha contains an amino acid called l-theanine, which helps your body absorb the caffeine more slowly, says Gans. (To be clear, coffee doesn't contain this magical stuff.) That's not to say experiencing a caffeine crash after chugging matcha isn't possible, but \"l-theanine is believed to have a calming effect on the body,” she explains.\n\n\nStill, it's best to limit yourself to three to four cups of matcha per day so you don’t go over the Dietary Guidelines for Americans’ recommended limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, Miyashita notes.\n\n\nIs there such a thing as decaf matcha?\n\nIf you want to sip on a pretty green latte without worrying about caffeine at all, you're in luck.\n\nDecaf matcha does exist, Gans says. However, keep in mind that you might not get all of its perks if you go this route. “The process of eliminating caffeine may remove some of the antioxidants,” she says. Ultimately, it's a cost-benefit thing. If caffeine is an absolute no for you, go for the decaf.\n\nSo, should you opt for matcha instead of coffee?\n\nUltimately, whether you decide to sip on matcha or coffee for a tasty boost depends on your personal preferences. If you can’t stand the taste of matcha, don't force yourself to get into it just for the sake of that EGCG. However, if you like both matcha and coffee, there are a few times you might want to reach for a cup of the green powder instead of your usual java.\n\nRELATED STORY\n5 Genius New Ways to Use Matcha\n\nMatcha is good for “people who want some caffeine in the morning or afternoon but want to avoid a caffeine crash,” Miyashita says. (Thanks again, l-theanine!)\n\nIt’s also worth trying matcha if coffee just hasn’t been doing it for you lately. “Both matcha and coffee provide numerous health benefits, but if you are sensitive to caffeine or find coffee to be too acidic, matcha may be a gentler alternative that still offers some caffeine,” says Cording.\n\nThe bottom line: Matcha's caffeine content is generally lower than coffee's, and it contains l-theanine, which may slow the effects of its caffeine for a gentler effect. That said, both coffee and matcha offer multiple health benefits, so which you drink comes down to preference.\n\nKORIN MILLER\nKorin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

It typically contains more caffeine than other types of green tea. But too much caffeine may also have harmful effects.\n\nMatcha is a powdered green tea from the plant Camellia sinensis and is mainly grown in Japan.\n\nDue to the way it’s grown, matcha is very high in antioxidants — compounds that protect against cell damage in the body that may lead to disease (1\nTrusted Source\n, 2\nTrusted Source\n).\n\nThe caffeine content of matcha also tends to be higher than other varieties of green tea.\n\nThis article reviews how much caffeine is in matcha and how to make it.\n\nShare on Pinterest\nJOANNA NIXON//Stocksy United\nWhat is caffeine?\n\nCaffeine is a substance naturally found in tea, coffee, and chocolate and acts as a stimulant in the body.\n\nThe stimulant properties of caffeine mean that it triggers activity in the central nervous system that translates to feeling energized and alert (3\nTrusted Source\n).\n\nMany people drink beverages with caffeine, like matcha, to boost energy and focus.\n\nRegular caffeine intake may also help reduce the risk of several diseases, such as the risk of stroke, heart disease, and some cancers. However, too much caffeine may also have harmful effects (4\nTrusted Source\n).\n\nWhile there is no standardized recommendation for caffeine intake, most experts suggest that adults should not consume more than 400 mg of caffeine per day to avoid potentially negative health effects (5\nTrusted Source\n).\n\nBut the amount of caffeine that’s tolerable and beneficial depends on the person. Keep that in mind when incorporating matcha into your diet.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nCaffeine is a natural stimulant that helps boost energy levels and alertness. It is found in matcha and other teas, coffee, and chocolate.\n\nHow much caffeine is in matcha?\n\nThe caffeine content of matcha can vary based on the type of leaves, how much powder you use to make the tea, and brewing time (2\nTrusted Source\n, 6\nTrusted Source\n).\n\nGenerally, matcha contains 19–44 mg of caffeine per gram. A typical serving of matcha is between 2–4 grams (1/2–1 teaspoon), which would then contain anywhere between 38–176 mg of caffeine (2\nTrusted Source\n).\n\nFor reference, coffee beans have 10–12 mg of caffeine per gram. An 8-ounce (240 mL) cup containing 10 grams of coffee has roughly 100 mg of caffeine (2\nTrusted Source\n).\n\nSo, depending on how concentrated the matcha tea is, a serving of matcha tea could have a lower or higher caffeine content than a serving of coffee.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nMatcha contains 19–44 mg of caffeine per gram or about 38-176 mg of caffeine per cup. The caffeine in a typical serving of matcha depends on how much powder is used, how fresh it is, and how it’s brewed.\n\nCaffeine in matcha vs. regular green tea\n\nMatcha is higher in caffeine than regular green tea.\n\nOne cup (240 mL) of green tea is estimated to contain about 30 mg of caffeine. A serving of matcha made with 2–4 grams (1/2–1 teaspoon) of powder could have a caffeine content between 38–176 mg of caffeine (2\nTrusted Source\n, 7\nTrusted Source\n).\n\nHowever, studies suggest that the caffeine content of green tea varies depending on the type, freshness, and brewing time (8\nTrusted Source\n).\n\nOne study found that caffeine in green tea ranged from 10–23 mg of caffeine per gram of tea leaves or 20–90 mg of caffeine per cup (8\nTrusted Source\n).\n\nWith 19–44 mg of caffeine per gram, matcha is higher in caffeine than most regular green teas (2\nTrusted Source\n).\n\nSUMMARY\n\nMatcha contains more caffeine per gram and in a typical serving than most green teas. A typical cup of matcha contains 38–176 mg of caffeine, while a regular cup of green tea may contain 20–90 mg of caffeine.\n\nHow to make matcha\n\nTo make a cup of matcha tea, you need matcha powder, a mug or cup, hot water, and a bamboo matcha whisk (chasen) or regular whisk. You may also want to use a small mesh sieve or tea strainer.\n\nOnce you have your tools, follow these steps:\n\nSpoon 2-4 grams (1/2-1 teaspoon) matcha powder into a tea strainer or small mesh sieve over a mug or cup. Sift the matcha to prevent clumping.\nPour a small amount of hot water on top of the powder. Whisk the powder in the water until it gets foamy on top.\nAdd the rest of the hot water.\nEnjoy!\nSUMMARY\n\nYou can make matcha at home by whisking matcha powder with hot water.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nMatcha tea is a type of green tea that contains caffeine.\n\nIt is higher in caffeine than most regular green teas and may contain more caffeine than coffee, depending on how much powder you use. However, matcha’s caffeine also varies depending on type, freshness, and brewing time.\n\nYou can drink matcha tea for a caffeine boost. It’s easy to make at home, or you can find it at some coffee shops and cafes.\n\nJust one thing\n\nTry this today: Make a homemade latte with matcha. After whisking matcha with a little bit of hot water, add steamed milk of your choice. To sweeten it, you can add some maple syrup, honey, or brown sugar.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nLast medically reviewed on May 13, 2022\n\nHow we reviewed this article:\nHISTORY\n\nOur experts continually monitor the health and wellness space, and we update our articles when new information becomes available.\n\nCurrent Version\n\nMay 13, 2022\n\nWritten By\n\nLizzie Streit\n\nEdited By\n\nAdda Bjarnadottir, MS, RDN (Ice)\n\nMedically Reviewed By\n\nMarie Lorraine Johnson MS, RD, CPT\n\nCopy Edited By\n\nNutrition Copy Editors\n\nShare this article\n\nMedically reviewed by Marie Lorraine Johnson MS, RD, CPT — By Lizzie Streit, MS, RDN, LD on May 13, 2022\nA List of 50 Super Healthy Foods\nThe 9 Best Foods and Drinks to Have Before Bed\n10 Anti-Aging Foods to Support Your 40s-and-Beyond Body\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nREAD THIS NEXT\nHow Do Matcha and Coffee Compare?\nBy Ariane Lang, BSc, MBA\n\nMatcha is a popular type of Japanese green tea, and coffee is one of the world's most commonly consumed beverages.

This is more caffeine than other types of green tea. It also contains antioxidants such as vitamin C, quercetin, and l-theanine.\n\nUnlike other types of green tea, which consist of tea leaves a person infuses in water, matcha consists of powdered tea leaves. Because of this, matcha has a higher caffeine content\nTrusted Source\n than some other types of tea.\n\nRead on to learn more about how much caffeine is in matcha tea, how different factors affect the caffeine content, and what to do if a person has consumed too much.\n\nWhat is matcha?\nShare on Pinterest\nTerapat Pattanakru/EyeEm/Getty Images\n\nMatcha is a type of green tea. It originates in Japan and comes from the Camellia sinensis plant. This is the same plant that black, white, and other types of green tea come from.\n\nHowever, matcha growers produce the tea in a traditional way, covering the tea plants with bamboo mats for most of the growing season to shade them from direct sunlight.\n\nShading enables the tea plants to produce higher\nTrusted Source\n amounts of amino acids and antioxidant compounds than non-matcha green tea. Manufacturers then turn the tea leaves into a powder. It has a vibrant green color and a unique, non-bitter taste.\n\nDoes matcha powder contain caffeine?\n\nThe caffeine content of matcha varies depending on the source of the leaves and how strong a person makes their tea. However, it is generally quite high.\n\nMatcha contains between 18.9 and 44.4 milligrams of caffeine per gram of tea (mg/g)\nTrusted Source\n. For comparison, most coffee beans contain around 10–12 mg/g of caffeine.\n\nHowever, the caffeine content of these beverages per cup depends on how a person makes them.\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that matcha can contain between 1 and 4 g of tea powder. Assuming a person makes strong matcha with 4 g of powder, the caffeine content for one cup would be between 75.6 and 177.6 mg.\n\nWhat affects the caffeine content of matcha?\n\nThe following factors\nTrusted Source\n affect the caffeine content of matcha tea:\n\nthe quantity of matcha powder a person uses\nthe temperature of the water\nthe age of the tea leaves\nthe time of harvesting\n\nUsing more matcha powder and higher temperatures will increase the amount of caffeine per cup while using less powder or less hot water will have the opposite effect.\n\nUsing milk to brew the tea will not reduce the caffeine content any more than water.\n\nHow does matcha compare to other drinks?\n\nAccording to research from 2021\nTrusted Source\n, matcha contains more caffeine per gram than coffee and other teas. However, how people make or brew their tea and coffee significantly impacts the caffeine content per cup.\n\nThe following table compares the amounts of caffeine in several popular caffeinated beverages.\n\nCaffeine comparison per gram\n\nThe figures below show how much caffeine each substance contains per gram of tea leaves or coffee beans:\n\nType of drink\tCaffeine content per gram\nMatcha\t18.9–44.4 mg/g\nTrusted Source\n\nGreen tea\t11.3–24.67 mg/g\nBlack tea\t14.3–34.8 mg/g\nCoffee\t10–12 mg/g\nCaffeine comparison per cup\n\nThe figures below show the average amount of caffeine per cup in these four beverages:\n\nBeverage\tCaffeine content per cup\nMatcha\taround 75.6 to 177.6 mg\nTrusted Source\n\nGreen tea\t30–40 mg\nTrusted Source\n\nBlack tea\t64–112 mg\nTrusted Source\n\nCoffee\t80–100 mg\nTrusted Source\nEffects of caffeine\n\nSome people tolerate caffeine well and may only notice a small increase in energy and focus when they drink matcha tea. Others may experience side effects.\n\nSome potential signs a person is experiencing side effects from caffeine include:\n\nanxiety or “jitters”\nfast heartbeat\nnausea\nheadache\ndifficulty sleeping\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nTrusted Source\n notes that some people are more sensitive to caffeine than others. People with underlying heart and other conditions may also be more vulnerable\nTrusted Source\n to the effects.\n\nIf a person experiences symptoms from consuming too much caffeine, it may help to:\n\ndrink lots of water\neat food\ngo for a gentle walk to reduce anxiety\ntake deep breaths from the diaphragm to promote calmness\ndo something to distract them from the anxiety, such as reading a book or watching a movie\n\nAlthough rare, caffeine overdose is possible. If a person experiences confusion, hallucinations, difficulty breathing, convulsions, or other severe symptoms, they should dial 911 for emergency help.\n\nSummary\n\nMatcha contains caffeine. The amount depends on a number of factors, including the age of the tea leaves and the amount of matcha powder a person uses. However, it generally has more caffeine in it than other types of tea.\n\nSome people are more sensitive to caffeine than others. To gauge tolerance, a person may wish to make a cup with only half a teaspoon at first. If they tolerate this dose well, they could start to increase the amount of matcha in their cup if they prefer a stronger tea.\n\nLast medically reviewed on August 19, 2022\n\nNutrition / Diet\nHow we reviewed this article:\nSOURCES\n\nShare this article\n\nMedically reviewed by Katherine Marengo LDN, R.D., Nutrition — By Mary West — Updated on February 9, 2023\nLatest news\nLSD could be effective in treating anxiety, clinical trial shows\nEosinophilic esophagitis: How the drug Dupixent has improved treatment\nWhy weight loss drugs stop working and how to break past the Ozempic plateau\nCould researchers develop a vaccine to lower bad cholesterol?\nMedication shows promise in treating childhood disease that can make eating difficult\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nRELATED COVERAGE\nMNT investigates: Can diet 'cure' chronic pain?\n\nMNT investigates whether changing one's diet and incorporating certain foods such as probiotics may be able to alleviate some of the symptoms of…\n\nREAD MORE\nHoliday weight gain may have long-term impact\n\nNew research suggests that it is very difficult to shed weight gained through lavish winter holiday meals, particularly among people with obesity…\n\nREAD MORE\nHoliday desserts: Are Great British Bake Off recipes unhealthy?\n\nThe mouthwatering desserts on The Great British Bake Off TV show may not be as unhealthy as you think, according to a new tongue-in-cheek BMJ study.\n\nREAD MORE\n2023 in medicine: Artificial sweeteners, colon cancer, and male birth control\n\nIn this wrap-up of medical research in 2023, Medical News Today’s editors delve into three interesting topics: artificial sweeteners, colon cancer…\n\nREAD MORE\nChia seeds could lead to future treatments for high blood pressure and cancer\n\nResearchers have sequenced the genome of the chia seed and identified numerous genes linked to the health benefits of the small but mighty superfood…\n\nREAD MORE\nGet our newsletter\n\nKeep up with the ever-changing world of medical science with new and emerging developments in health.\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nYour privacy is important to us.
